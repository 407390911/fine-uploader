            <h1>About Fine Uploader</h1>
            <p class="marketing-byline">The world's best native, highly customizable JavaScript file uploader library.</p>

            <h2>Brief Description</h2>
            <p>Fine Uploader aims to make file-uploading on the web possible in every browser and mobile device. It is cross-browser,
                dependency-free, and 100% JavaScript. The product is highly customizable, and allows integrators to fine-tune every aspect of their users’
                upload experience. Implementation requires only a single CSS file, a JavaScript file, and a server to upload to. Fine Uploader users enjoy
                widespread browser support and a suite of features, resulting in a smooth experience when uploading files to a website.
            </p>

            <p>Fine Uploader is a product of <a href="http://www.widen.com">Widen Enterprises</a> and ongoing development is led by
                <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ray-nicholus/46/31/780" target="new">Ray Nicholus.</a>
            </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Fine Uploader originally existed as file-uploader, and has also been known as valums/file-uploader (due to its location on GitHub).
               Andrew Valums created file-uploader in 2010 as an improved version of “ajax-uploader”, also hosted on GitHub as a free open source project.
            </p>

            <p>In August 2012, Andrew handed the project over to Ray Nicholus, and Ray has been maintaining and evolving this library since 2.0, when it was renamed Fine Uploader.</p>

            <p>In March 2013, Widen Enterprises took over the development and management of Fine Uploader, with Ray Nicholus continuing as lead developer.</p>

            <h2>Highlights</h2>
            <p>Fine Uploader is a useful library for developers who want to tightly integrate the ability to upload files into their own web applications, regardless of the browser,
                without a required dependency on any third party libraries. Fine Uploader does not use Flash or Java. It’s pure JavaScript.

            </p>

            <p>Fine Uploader Basic is great for those who want a very specific look for their upload tool, and want to develop their own UI, but not worry about writing code to deal
                with client-side cross-browser upload processing.
            </p>

            <h2>Features & Support</h2>
            <p>Fine Uploader boasts a significant amount of <a href="http://docs.fineuploader.com/overview/features.html">features</a>, with more planned. The issue tracker in
                the GitHub project contains all planned features. Support is available in the <a href="http://fineuploader.com/support.html">user forums</a>.  Developers Ray Nicholus
                and Mark Feltner answer most support and pull requests (almost always the same day).
            </p>

            <p>We’re always open to suggestions regarding possible improvements or new features. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Widen/fine-uploader/issues/new">open up a request</a>
                in the issue tracker if you have something you’d like to see in Fine Uploader.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
            <p>Since ownership of the project has been transferred to Widen Enterprises, Fine Uploader has continued to evolve into the web’s finest tool for uploading from the browser.
                Having the backing of an established company such as Widen means the developers can continue adding more features to the product, draw on the wealth of resources provided
                by Widen, and ensure the stability of the product for the future. The fact that Fine Uploader is tightly integrated with other Widen products means that Fine Uploader
                will not be going away anytime soon. In fact, there are big things planned for the future!
            </p>

            <p>The Fine Uploader team is happily hacking away at the next great set of features. Penned in for the future is greater support for the growing number of
                cloud-based storage solutions such as Amazon’s S3 and Microsoft’s Azure, continued support for new and evolving web standards, a sleeker and more intuitive
                user interface, as well as a plethora of other great features like file detection, image previews, and much, much more.
            </p>

            <p>If you can’t tell already, we are all <strong>really</strong> excited about the future of Fine Uploader.</p>
